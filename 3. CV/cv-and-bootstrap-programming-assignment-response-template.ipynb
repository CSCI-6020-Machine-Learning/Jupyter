    "used in order to compute the LOOCV test error estimate. Alternatively, one could compute those quantities using just the glm() and predict.glm() functions, and a for loop. You will now take this approach in order to compute the LOOCV error for a simple logistic regression model on the Weekly dataset. Recall that in the context\n",
